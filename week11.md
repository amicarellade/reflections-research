Violinboxplot and enhanced radar plot as components of effective graphical dashboards: An educational example of sports analytics

This paper attacks the abuse of the radar plot and introduces a "more educational visualization" called the violinboxplot. The authors first elaborate on the problems a radar/spider/web plot have. This includes the misreading of information and the charts ability to distract the user from viewing tha pattern of the line and highlightin the plot area (which is not the main focus). Additionally, the use of varying scales causes room for misinterpretation when viewing a radar chart like this. Finally, the authors complain that radar charts cause "random" correlation that may exist between two variables. 

In contrast, the authors speak highly of simple graphs such as a boxplot and violin plots as they include more information and are able to identify outliers. The violinboxplot set forth is great at finding several atypical data that would not be usually percieved in the usual violinplot. Furthermore, when added to a radar chart, the violinboxplot aims to facilitiate graph misinterpration by liveraging the symmetry of the plot. 

Overall, the graph created by the authors is very appealing on the eye and introduces a new ideal to circular charts. Do the authors believe that all radar charts abuse the "power" of the visualization? What is the scale accross the whole chart is consistent?
