The intricate nature of golf, with its ever-changing variables, demands a keen understanding of ball trajectory for players. Visualizing the ball's path is crucial, guiding players in their shot selection and swing execution. This paper pioneers the use of artificial neural networks to develop a heuristic for predicting golf ball trajectories based solely on swing plane analysis. This innovation holds significant value for golf coaches and instructors, simplifying their assessment process and enabling more precise guidance for players.

By dissecting various elements of the golf swing, the authors establish a causal relationship between swing mechanics and ball trajectory. They emphasize the importance of feature selection in the model, prioritizing key elements that influence ball movement. Leveraging Human Motion Modeling and Analysis (HMMA), the authors gather swing data using sensors, processing it for input into the model. In the paper, a k-means clustering visualiation is shown to provide evidence of the non-linearly seperable captured golf swing data with the clusters being the outputs with a relatively high degree in overlap. Operating at a overall accuracy of just under 90%, the authors were able to take high-dimensional swing data and predict the trajectory of a golf ball.
