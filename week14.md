The game of golf is a complex variable-enduced sport that can change very quickly. Understanding the trajectory of the ball is very important to players as it helps them visualize in their head what shot they need to hit and how they need to swing. This paper introduces the usage of artificial neural networks to create a heuristic for golf ball trajectories based solely on the swing plane. The idea behind creating an infrastructure able to predict the trajectory of a golf ball is valuable to the teaching of a golf swing for coaches and intstructors of the game. By simplifying what a coach needs to be looking at, they are then able to give more accurate advice to the player. The authors model a cause and effect relationship by breaking up different elements of the golf swing to measure the trajectory of the golf ball. In the paper, the authors discuss the value of feature selection for the model to weight elements of the swing that are tell-tale signs that cause the ball to move in the direction it did. Using a HMMA (Human Motion Modelling and Analysis) the authors collected samples of data through sensors and processed them to then feed into the model. In the paper, a k-means clustering visualiation is shown to provide evidence of the non-linearly seperable captured golf swing data with the clusters being the outputs with a relatively high degree in overlap. Operating at a overall accuracy of just under 90%, the authors were able to take high-dimensional swing data and predict the trajectory of a golf ball.
