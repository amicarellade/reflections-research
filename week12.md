The Impact of Scrolleytelling on the Reading Experience of Long-Form Journalism

This research paper investigates the effect that scrollytelling has on the younger generation within journalism. Made famous by _The New York Times_ article _"Snow Fall"_, scrolleytelling engaged the audience by combining the act of scrolling to unfold the story presented. The authors discuss that articles such as these tend to be introduced with a full-screen image or video and through scrolling the image updates dynamically. The main thesis of this paper was to perfrom a controlled experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness of scrollytelling articles to those that are not. 

As a whole, the researchers found that scrollytelling has had a positive impact on story telling as it has made the content of the story more engaging. With its usage of animation and focus on certain details, respondents found it to be less time-consuing to read, fun and engaging, and feelings of increased focus. While, yes, there were negative comments, scrollytelling seems to be a resounding successs. Taking a step further, the authors investigated when to use scrollytelling and when not to. Some examples for when included when there is a lot of text and educational, when there is less text and it is less complicated subject, or when you need to focus on the point and compare. On the other hand, some situations when it would not be appropriate were when it is a heavy topic or if it is a scholarly literature. 

In the end, the effect scrollytelling has had on the journalism community seems positive, but it should not be confused with a cosmetic that can be applied to all.
