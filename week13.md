Article: "ForVizor: Visualizing Spatio-Temporal Tema Formations in Soccer"

This article dives into the analysis of formation within soccer using spatio-temporal data to address problems of formation analysis in soccer, and, as a result formulate several design goals. Overall, the authors focus on the fluidity of formation based on game-scenarios and how the current spatio-temporal data fails to capture such an important part of the game. The overall data-processing step shown in the article demonstrates the difficulty of converting raw video data into a functional visualization. For instance, in their example the authors show how a color histogram and particle filter are used to track players from an original match video then use least-square method to plot their postions using matrices. Prior to the detection result being achieved, the data has to iterate through multiple steps in order to receive the proper location distribution for each player. Since the data is so sparse and impacted by noise, mean filtering has to be used to smoothen the results. These were the main questions they were attempting to address with ForVizor: Ho do game situations evolve over time? What is the frequency of formation pairs? What is the effect of a formation change? in order to properly adapt their analytical tool. As a whole, the web-application demonstrates a match between two teams with absolute emphasis on formations. 

Soccer, like most sports, reacts negatively to the uniform use of sports analytics. Some believe football is too complicated to model using data and other believe there are parts of the game that cannot be described by data. Regardless, the authors took to experts in the football field to acquire the ground truth. Thus, by allowing them to label the data throughout a match and compare it to the results of ForVizor, the authors were able to see how accurately their model truly performed. Overall, this project was fascinating but due to the limited amount of raw high resolution panoramic data causes the authors to be limited in terms of data.
